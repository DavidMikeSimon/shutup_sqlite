h2. Shut up, SQLite!

<pre>
 SQL (6.0ms)    SELECT name
 FROM sqlite_master
 WHERE type = 'table' AND NOT name = 'sqlite_sequence'
</pre>

Hate it when the above useless message fills up big portions of your Rails development log?

Me too! This plugin filters them out, but still logs all other SQL queries normally.
