h2. Shut up, SQLite!

<pre>
 SQL (6.0ms)    SELECT name
 FROM sqlite_master
 WHERE type = 'table' AND NOT name = 'sqlite_sequence'
</pre>

Hate it when the above useless message fills up big portions of your Rails development.log?

Me too! This plugin filters them out, but still logs all other SQL queries normally.
