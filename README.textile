h2. Shut up, SQLite!

<pre>
 SQL (6.0ms)    SELECT name
 FROM sqlite_master
 WHERE type = 'table' AND NOT name = 'sqlite_sequence'
</pre>

Hate it when the above useless message fills up big portions of your Rails development log?

Me too! This plugin filters them out, but still logs all other SQL queries normally. It's compatible with both Rails 2 and 3.

h2. Installation

Just add it to your Gemfile, then allow the now soothingly high relevance of your log files wash over you and relieve your stress.
